ESP8266 Digital Compass with Web UI & Wi-Fi Configurator
This project turns an ESP8266 and a QMC5883L magnetometer into a smart digital compass. It features a dual-mode Wi-Fi logic: if it cannot find a saved network, it creates its own Access Point (Hotspot) allowing you to configure Wi-Fi credentials via a web browser. Once configured, it connects to your local network and serves a real-time, dark-themed compass dashboard.
🚀 Features
•	Auto-Hotspot (Captive Portal Style): Automatically starts a hotspot if no Wi-Fi is configured.
•	EEPROM Storage: Remembers your Wi-Fi SSID and Password even after power loss.
•	Real-time Web UI: A mobile-responsive dashboard that refreshes every 0.5 seconds.
•	Auto-Calibration: Built-in 30-second calibration routine on startup to ensure heading accuracy.
•	True North Correction: Adjustable magnetic declination setting.
🛠 Hardware Required
•	Microcontroller: ESP8266 (NodeMCU or Wemos D1 Mini)
•	Sensor: QMC5883L 3-Axis Magnetometer (I2C)
•	Cables: Jumper wires

💻 Software Setup
1.	Libraries: Install the following via the Arduino Library Manager:
o	QMC5883LCompass
o	ESP8266WiFi
o	ESP8266WebServer
2.	Declination: Update the #define DECLINATION value in the code based on your current city (find yours at magnetic-declination.com).
3.	Upload: Flash the code to your ESP8266.

📖 How It Works
Phase 1: Configuration (First Time Use)
1.	Power on the device.
2.	Search for Wi-Fi on your phone and connect to "Compass_Setup_AP".
3.	Open 192.168.4.1 in your browser.
4.	Enter your Home Wi-Fi SSID and Password and click Save.
5.	The device will save these to EEPROM and reboot.
Phase 2: Operation
1.	The ESP8266 connects to your home Wi-Fi.
2.	Check the Serial Monitor to find the new IP address assigned by your router.
3.	Open that IP address in any browser on your network.
4.	Calibration: Rotate the sensor in a "figure 8" motion for the first 30 seconds (indicated on screen).
5.	View your live heading and cardinal direction (N, NE, E, etc.).

📂 Code Structure
•	WiFi.softAP(): Handles the hotspot creation.
•	EEPROM.put() / EEPROM.get(): Manages permanent storage of credentials.
•	handleRoot(): Serves the HTML/CSS for the compass UI.
•	readCompass(): Calculates the heading using atan2(x, y) and applies hard-iron offsets.
